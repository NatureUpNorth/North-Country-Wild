# Upload and process images {#sec-Chapter3}

## Introduction

This chapter describes the workflow we use when coming back to the lab with SD cards from a recent game camera deployment. The script we use for processing these files is `upload_and_process_images.py` found in the PythonScripts directory of this repository. The script includes some subcommands that can do only select pieces of the workflow. Typically, however, you would use the subcommand `completely_process_images_from_sd_card` if you are trying to complete the whole workflow in one pass.

## The script and its subcommands

The script `upload_and_process_images.py` has the following possible subcommands:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-1
#| tbl-cap: upload_and_process_images.py subcommands
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(reactable)
library(reactablefmtr)

df <- read_csv(here("documentation/data/upload_and_process_subcommands.csv")) #read in table of subcommands

table_1 <- reactable(
  df[,2:3],
  columns = list(
    subcommand_name = colDef(name = "Subcommand name"), #assign first col name
    subcommand_purpose = colDef(name = "Subcommand purpose")), #assign second col name
  bordered = TRUE,
  striped = TRUE,
  highlight = TRUE
  ) #create table 1
table_1
```
