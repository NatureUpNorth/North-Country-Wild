# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book provides documentation for the codebase in this repository associated with the North Country Wild research project based in the research lab of [Erika Barthelmess](https://www.stlawu.edu/people/erika-barthelmess), Professor of Biology at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York.

The North Country Wild Project, also known as "NoCoWild" or "NoCo Wild," also includes a community science aspect in that community members help to identify wildlife in game camera images [through our platform on the Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/barthelmess/north-country-wild). We are aspiring to a stage in which community members can also host borrowed (from us) or their own game cameras on their property and contribute images from those cameras to the project.

The community science aspect of the project is supported by the team at [Nature Up North](https://natureupnorth.org). You can find more details about the North Country Wild project on our [project landing page](https://www.natureupnorth.org/north-country-wild) on the Nature Up North website.
